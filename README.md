# ArduWar

ArduWar is a WoW Pixel Reading Rotation Bot using AutoIt or an Arduino to simulate the Keyboard Clicks written in Java.

# Setup:

First of all, you need a Rotation Addon like TellMeWhen or AethysRotation (what I recommend). For the ArduinoBot you will need a Arduino Leonardo!

## AutoIt

1. Start ArduWar.jar 
2. Navigate to the Rotation Addon, best Position is on the Red Dot.

3. Press F3 to Save the Addon Position
4. Now cast the Rotation on a Target Dummy, if you get a new Spell press F2 to add the Skill to the Skill Window.
5. The Skills need to be on Keybind 1-10.
6. You can add up to 10 Skill. If you use less, add some random color. (atm you need 10, will be fixed in the future)
7. Select a Profile and Press "Save"
8. Press "Start AutoIt" to start the AutoIt Bot and "Stop" to stop it. The Programm will send the Inputs to the most forward Window (Most likely WoW)

## Arduino

1. Start ArduWar.jar 
2. Navigate to the Rotation Addon, best Position is on the Red Dot.

7. Select a Profile and Press "Save"
8. Connect you Arduino Leonardo and upload the Code (https://github.com/Stepoura/ArduWarArduino)
9. Select the Port (COM1, COM2, etc) where the Arduino is connected
10. Press F4 or "Start Arduino" to start and F5 or "Stop" to stop.


Keep in Mind this is a private Project of me. It is not easy to understand or to configure and it contains most likely many bugs. :)
